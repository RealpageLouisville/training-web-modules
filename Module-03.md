# Module 3: PHP Coding Standards

***

## Getting Started

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material:
- [PHP PSR-2 Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

***

## The Test

Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `psr-2` and refactor your PHP code to conform to the PSR-2 standard. Be sure to write all your future PHP code to conform to PSR-2.

***

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, push your code to Bitbucket. Please create a tag called `v1.3` with a message of `"ready for review"`. Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in Bitbucket.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 3 - PHP Coding Standards** and `@mention` your mentor and team leader.

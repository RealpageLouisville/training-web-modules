# Module 3: PHP Coding Standards

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material.  

**PSR-2 is the PHP coding standard that all new PHP development will conform to at Indatus.**

* [PHP PSR-2 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)


## The Test

Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `psr-2` and refactor your PHP code to conform to the PSR-2 standard.  Be sure to write all your future PHP code to conform to PSR-2.

----------

When you are done, push your code to GIT under this branch, then merge this branch back into 'master' (but don't delete this branch).  Please create a tag called `v1.3` with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitLab.

Any required communication will again be done on the "issues" feature for the project so this feature **MUST** be enabled in the settings for each repo.  Once your work from this module has been accepted move on to the next module.  You **can** move on to the next module prior to approval, but be aware that some modules build on others output so you may be creating more work for yourself if one module's output needs modification to be accepted.

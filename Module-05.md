# Module 5: PHP Documentation

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material.

**PHPDocumentor2's 2.0 release documentation standard is the standard that new PHP development will conform to at Indatus.**

* [PHPDoc Documentation Standards](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/blob/v2.0.0/docs/PSR.md)


## The Test


Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `documentation` and commit all the work from this module there.  Again be sure to write any code to conform to the `PSR-2` standard.

Add documentation to your code that conforms to the documentation spec above.

----------

When you are done, push your code to Bitbucket.  Please create a tag called `v1.5` with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in Bitbucket.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 5 - PHP Docuemntation** and @mention your mentor and team leader.

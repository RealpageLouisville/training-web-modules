# Module 5: PHP Documentation

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material.  

**PHPDocumentor2's 2.0 release documentation standard is the standard that new PHP development will conform to at Indatus.**

* [PHPDoc Documentation Standards](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/blob/release-2.0/docs/PSR.md)


## The Test


Create a new branch in your 'php-final' git repo called 'documentation' and commit all the work from this module there.  Again be sure to write any code to conform to the PSR-2 standard.

Add documentation to your code that conforms to the documentation spec above.

----------

When you are done, push your code to GIT under this branch, then merge this branch back into 'master' (but don't delete this branch). Please create a tag called **v1.5** with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitLab.

Any required communication will again be done on the "wall" for the project so this feature **MUST** be enabled in the settings for each repo.  Once your work from this module has been accepted you'll a) receive credit for completing this module and b) get access to start the next module.

# Module 6: Codeception

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material.  

* [How to Write Testable and Maintainable Code in PHP](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/how-to-write-testable-and-maintainable-code-in-php/)
* [Modern Testing In PHP With Codeception](https://tutsplus.com/course/modern-testing-in-php-with-codeception/)
* [Codeception Documentation](http://codeception.com/docs/01-Introduction)

Before you can run codeception on your Mac, you'll need to add a `date.timezone` configuration to your `/etc/php.ini.default` and rename it to `php.ini`.

## The Test


Create a new branch in your 'php-final' git repo called 'codeception' and commit all the work from this module there.  Again be sure to write any code to conform to the PSR-2 standard.

1.  Install Codeception using Composer
2.  Using Codeception and your basic MVC application create at least 1 of each of the following tests:
	a.  Unit Test
	b.  Acceptance Test using the PhpBrowser back-end
	
3.  => Stage, Commit and push your code to GIT.
4.  Refactor your Acceptance test settings to use Codeception's WebDriver as the back-end.

When you are done, push your code to Bitbucket.  Please create a tag called `v1.6` with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in Bitbucket.

## The Test


Create a new repository in your GitLab namespace called 'Laravel-Test' and commit all the work from this module there. 

Build a Laravel application with the features, functions, entities etc of your choosing as long as the application meets the criteria below.  Be creative and resourceful but at the same time don't take 10 years to build your app.

#### Application Criteria

**When your building your application and meeting a specific criteria below you should use a relevant commit message to indicate that your commit is satisfying a particular criteria.**

1.  Build your features using Test First Development, don't write any feature code until the failing test is created first.  Write the test, write code to make it pass, then refactor.  Rinse & Repeat.

2.  Use Codeception to build your tests with.

3.  **Follow the [Indatus Laravel framework development standards](http://helpdesk.indatus.com/KB/a198/laravel-php-framework-development-standards.aspx)**.  There is a lot of requirements that will guide your development here.

4.  Integrate user authentication

5.  Integrate sending email (with HTML and Plain Text versions of the email)

6.  All your models should have validation.  Between all your models make sure you have at least one of the following validation rules:

	a.  Required
	b.  Numeric
	c.  Required If
	d.  Regex
	e.  Email
	f.	Url
	g.  Use a custom error message
	h.  Custom validation rule
	
7.  All models should account for mass-assignment vulnerabilities by using the `fillable` or `guarded` properties.

8.  Make sure your application is protected from the following security vulnerabilities.  The framework may or may not handle some of this for you, verify to be sure.

	a.  XSS
	b.  SQL-Injection
	c.  CSRF
	d.  Session-Fixation

9.  Include a minimum of 4 different Entities (excluding lookups).

10. Include the following relationships:

	a.  At least 1 relationship for each model
	b.  1+ belongs to relationship
	c.  1+ has many relationship
	d.  1+ has one relationship
	e.  1+ has and belongs to many relationship
	f.  1+ polymorphic relationship
	
11.  CRUD interface for at least 1 model.

12.  Handle uploading an image that is a property of an entity.  (something like `$user->avatar`).  Have 1+ alternative image representations created from the uploaded image (i.e. thumbnail etc.).  You may consider using 1 or more packages to help do this.

13.  Include at least 2 'resourceful' routes and controllers.

14.  Subscribe to at least one event.  This can be a built in event or a custome event you fire.

15.  Create at least one Facade.

16.  Use pagination at least once.

17.  Use 2+ Queues, 1 for sending email (in #5) and one custome queue.

18.  Use at least one query scope in your application.




----------

When you are done, push your code to GitLab.  Please create a tag called **v1.8** with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitLab.

Any required communication will again be done on the "wall" for the project so this feature **MUST** be enabled in the settings for each repo.  Once your work from this module has been accepted move on to the next module.  You **can** move on to the next module prior to approval, but be aware that some modules build on others output so you may be creating more work for yourself if one module's output needs modification to be accepted.

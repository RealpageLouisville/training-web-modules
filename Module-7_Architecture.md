## The Test


Create a new branch in your 'php-final' git repo called 'architecture' and commit all the work from this module there. 

1.  FLUSH OUT


----------

When you are done, push your code to GIT under this branch, then merge this branch back into 'master' (but don't delete this branch).  Please create a tag called **v1.7** with a message of 'ready for review'.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitLab.

Any required communication will again be done on the "wall" for the project so this feature **MUST** be enabled in the settings for each repo.  Once your work from this module has been accepted you'll a) receive credit for completing this module and b) get access to start the next module.
